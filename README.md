# numericalMethod
implement various classic numerical algorithms 

This repository is inspired by the course ECE204 from the University of Waterloo. The organization will closely follow the ECE204 course taught by Lecturer D.W. Harder

Approximation of the value of mathematic expressions 
Approximation of solutions to algebric equations
Approximation of solutions to analytic equations
