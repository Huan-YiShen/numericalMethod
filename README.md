# Numerical Method - The Art of Approximation
implement various classic numerical algorithms 

This repository is inspired by the course ECE204 from the University of Waterloo. The organization of its content will closely follow the ECE204 course taught by Lecturer D.W. Harder. The repository will implement various numerical algorithms to approximate following categories of mathematic objects

Approximate values of mathematic expressions<br>
Approximate of solutions to algebric equations<br>
Approximate of solutions to analytic equations<br>

## Getting Started
`$ python -m venv venv` (first venv indicate the venv module, second venv is the name of your virtual environment, can be anything)<br>
`$ venv\Scripts\activate.bat` <br>
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
`$ deactivate (to exit the venv)` <br>

export new requirements <br>
`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`
