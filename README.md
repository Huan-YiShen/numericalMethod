# numericalMethod
implement various classic numerical algorithms 

This repository is inspired by the course ECE204 from the University of Waterloo. The organization will closely follow the ECE204 course taught by Lecturer D.W. Harder

Approximation of the value of mathematic expressions<br>
Approximation of solutions to algebric equations<br>
Approximation of solutions to analytic equations<br>

## Getting Started
`$ python -m venv venv` (first venv indicate the venv module, second venv is the name of your virtual environment, can be anything)<br>
`$ venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
`$ deactivate (to exit the venv)`

export new requirements
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
